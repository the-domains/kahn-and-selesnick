The evening of the premiere was hot; red-faced Burghers and their perspiring wives poured in and took their seats under the crimson pilasters and gilded crocodiles of the old Imperial Theater. As we were not to appear until the second act, we were forced to wait in the sweltering wings. Orlofsky and Lulu found this tiresome and predictably began drinking; not above a glass myself, I soon joined them. Before long we had finished several bottles of a cheap but rather fine sparkling Riesling I had picked up earlier to celebrate our success. Finally, our call! Orlofsky and Lulu joined together, and I zipped them into the ‘donkey’ costume –supposedly a horse, but the director had insisted this be accomplished in the tradition of the pantomime. This done, I was winched onto Orlofsky’s back (he was the rear of the animal, fittingly), and we tottered regally (so I imagined) onto the stage, to delighted titters from the audience. By the gurgling sounds coming from within my steed, I surmised with alarm that Orlofsky had stashed a further bottle in the creature’s muzzle. There was a loud guffaw from the snout, accompanied by a fine spray of Riesling. I could see the director gesiculating angrliy from the wings, but the audience took it as part of the effect. I administered a kick to the donkey’s hindquarters, and we lumbered forwards. Unbeknownst to me however, due to the sultry atmosphere in the theater, Lulu had discarded her clothes before donning the costume; I was also unaware that the two of them had recently begun a torrid love affair. Now, given the position of Orlofsky’s head within the creature . . . well, the reader can guess the effect on his stewed box. The animal reared forwards sending me toppling to the floor; moments later the writhing donkey had gone over the edge into the orchestra pit. The idiots, still trapped in the suit, lay there braying in the stunned silence that followed; unfortunately they had now forgotten themselves entirely, and Lulu, responding to Orlofsky’s overtures, bid him chase her. The donkey arose and began to stampede around the theater; one of the ushers managed to coral the animal, and in a misguided attempt to subdue it, delivered a solid blow to its muzzle. Never one to take an insult lying down, Lulu head-butted the poor man to the ground and proceeded to trample him with her hooves. He ran off but soon returned with several stagehands who managed to chase the inebriated donkey from the theater. The conductor, an altogether sound gentleman, addressed the audience: he hoped they had enjoyed the diversion, but the performance now would continue (minus the 3rd cello, smashed during the fracas). Burning with humiliation, I stood through the rest of the second act until my exit, somehow avoided the enraged director, and stumbled out to search for my foolish compatriots. 

Some while later I found them at the police station; the animal was at the desk (Orlofsky and Lulu had been unable to escape the outfit, and no one had seen fit to release them) being jokingly chastised by the duty officer. The director was also there, alternating screaming abuse at the donkey and imploring the constable to put the creature behind bars. Soon, the head of theatre arrived – I feared we might be subject to a large fine, but he immediately smoothed things over and placated the raving director. Taking me aside he told me the reaction to the show had been astounding, he had been barraged with requests for tickets; of course it wouldn’t do to repeat such an affront to so serious work as Der Grüne Wanderer, but clearly we had a gift for farce, and he was planning to produce a revival of Die Fledermaus. Perhaps we might help with the staging?  </p><picture>
